          We are pleased to welcome you to Winnipegâ€™s newest oral and
          maxillofacial surgical facilities. Our northeast Winnipeg location is
          approximately 8 minutes from downtown with easy access from Henderson
          Highway or Main Street (via the Redwood Bridge). This facility is
          located in the brand new Henderson Professional Centre located at 755
          Henderson Highway Suite 303. Our west Winnipeg location is at 2305
          Portage Avenue (intersection of Portage Ave. and Mount Royal Rd.).
          Both of our facilities are wheelchair accessible and have free
          parking.
